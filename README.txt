  prerequisites.


Installation

  If you have a suitable Zope/Plone installation, you can install
  ECReviewBox as follows:

  1. Extract the archive into the 'Products' directory of your Zope
     instance. (You can find out where your Zope instance is installed
     by opening the Zope Management Interface (ZMI) and going to the
     Control Panel; the directory listed as 'INSTANCE_HOME' is what
     you're looking for.)

  2. Restart Zope

  3. Use the 'portal_quickinstaller' of your Plone site in which you
     want to use ECReviewBox.
